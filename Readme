This Jupyter notebook generates the figures of the paper "Primal Dual Interpretation of the Proximal Stochastic Gradient Langevin Algorithm"

Just launch the cells sequentially. To generate the figures of the paper, you have to play with the parameters d (dimension of the problem), gamma (step size of the algorithms), and lamb (smoothing parameter of MYULA). lamblist is a list of smoothing parameters lamb.
